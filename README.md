# Pacman in Java

========== FAQ ==========

1) Why I can not open it (because of outdated Java)?  
You have probably an old version of Java on your computer. To update Java just simply go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html and download JRE version.


2) Is my system 32 or 64 bit?  
Windows: right click on Computer —> click on Properties —-> under “System” is the system type  
Linux: type “uname –a” in the terminal window and press Enter; 32-bit = “i686” or “i386”; 64-bit = “x86_64”.


3) Why are there folders “img” and “maps”?  
“img” folder contains all the images important for the game.  
“maps” folder contains maps for the game - you can change it if you want and make your own map. How to do it properly is written in the Credits part when you start the game.
